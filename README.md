This is a package for extracting multi-sychronous context free grammars,
described in the paper "Multi-target Machine Translation with Multi-synchronous
Context Free Grammars" presented in NAACL 2015. The main scripts are:

* `train-multi.pl`: Full training scripts
* `multi-extract.py`: A script for extracting the full grammar

Full scripts to reproduce the experiments in the paper can be found here:

Some of the extraction scripts rely on the Travatar toolkit:
